-notifprocess.php
-newtool.php (Will not be completed until Drive API) --> along with its process pages)

-studentlist.php

- Pages that still need to be created - 
The User creation and class creation pages!
The modification pages and buttons!


Pages that need Teacher-Student Differentiation
-Index.php (though not much!)
-Classpage.php - main one!
-assignment.php
-notification.php
-material.php

Pages students should not have access to:
-newassign.php
-newclass.php (this might change in the future, though not likely)
-newnotif.php
-All of the preceding processing pages!

Pages neither should have access to!
-ALL of the processing pages! 
-Need to find a way to secure the main login processing page ... from a url attack
